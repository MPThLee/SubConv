# Subtitle Converter

## What is this?
Just converting subtitles to different format.

## Supported formats
`SRT`, `WebVTT`, and will be more...

## Special Thanks
This project is inspired by [subtitle.js](https://github.com/gsantiago/subtitle.js).
Initial design is rewritting subtitle.js

## TODO
* SAMI(`.smi`) support
* DFXP a.k.a [TTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timed_Text_Markup_Language) Support (for netflix).
* ASS is not planned yet. It will be implements after DFXP support.

### wish
* `.IDX` or VobSub Subtitle(which used in Netflix's Image-based CC like Japanese) Support?
